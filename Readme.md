## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Java 17, Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Security (JWT), Spring Data JPA (Hibernate), Lombok

## 🔑 Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+
* Apache Maven 3.6+
* Git client
* MySQL Server (running locally or accessible)
* Stripe Account (Test keys: Publishable Key, Secret Key, Webhook Secret)
* Gmail Account + **App Password** (for `spring.mail.password` if using Gmail)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Clone:** `git clone <https://github.com/arunprakashxavier/bus-booking-app>`
2.  **Database:**
    * Start MySQL server.
    * Create a database named `busapp`.
    * Ensure a MySQL user exists with privileges on `busapp` (e.g., `root`/`your_password`).
3.  **Configure Secrets (Environment Variables):**
    * **IMPORTANT:** Since `application.properties` is excluded by `.gitignore`, set these environment variables in your IDE Run Configuration or OS:
        * `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`: Your MySQL password
        * `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Your Stripe Secret Key (`sk_test_...`)
        * `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Your Stripe Publishable Key (`pk_test_...`)
        * `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Your Stripe Webhook Secret (`whsec_...` from `stripe listen`)
        * `APP_JWTSECRET`: Your chosen JWT secret (long, random string)
        * `SPRING_MAIL_USERNAME`: Your Gmail address
        * `SPRING_MAIL_PASSWORD`: Your Gmail **App Password**
4.  **Build:** Navigate to the project root and run:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
5.  **Run:**
    * From IDE: Run the `BusappApplication.java` main method.
    * From command line: `mvn spring-boot:run`

    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints

API documentation is available via Swagger UI when the application is running:
[`http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

## Usage Guide

* **Access:** Open `http://localhost:8080` (redirects to `/login`).
* **User:** Register an account or log in. Use the dashboard to search for trips (e.g., Chennai -> Kanyakumari or Trichy -> Banglore for dates you added trips for). Select seats, enter passenger details, proceed to payment (use Stripe test card numbers), and check `/booking-history`. Edit profile via `/profile`.
* **Admin:** Log in with an admin account (you may need to create one, e.g., by updating a registered user's role directly in the database to `ROLE_ADMIN`). Access admin functions via the `/admin/...` paths in the navbar to manage buses, routes, scheduled trips, and view all bookings.

## 🐛 Known Issues / Troubleshooting

* **Email in Spam:** Emails sent via the basic Gmail SMTP setup might land in the spam folder. Mark them as "Not Spam" during testing. For production, use a dedicated transactional email service (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES).

## 💡 Future Ideas

* Implement Integration Tests (`@SpringBootTest`, `@WebMvcTest`).
* Refine CSS and UI components.
* Replace manual DTO mapping (e.g., with MapStruct).
* Implement visual seat layout selection.
* Add Pagination for lists (Admin pages, User History).
* Implement Booking Cancellation.
* Refactor `PaymentServiceImpl` to improve testability of `createPaymentIntent`.
* Confirm `@Value` works for webhook secret loading and remove `Environment` injection if preferred.
